abstract = {Prefix hijacking, a misbehavior in which a misconfigured or malicious BGP router originates
an IP prefix that the router does not own, is becoming an increasingly serious security
problem on the Internet. In this paper, we conduct a first comprehensive study on
incrementally deployable mitigation solutions against prefix hijacking. We first propose
a novel reactive detection-assisted solution based on the idea of bogus route purging
and valid route promotion. Our simulations based on realistic settings show that purging
bogus routes at 20 highest-degree ASes reduces the polluted portion of the Internet
by a random prefix hijack from 50% down to 24%, and adding promotion further reduces
the remaining pollution by 33% ~ 57%, We prove that our proposed route purging and
promotion scheme preserve the convergence properties of BGP regardless of the number
of promoters. We are the first to demonstrate that detection systems based on a limited
number of BGP feeds are subject to detection evasion by hijackers. Motivated the need
for proactive defenses to complement reactive mitigation response, we evaluate customer
route filtering, a best common practice among large ISPs today, and show its limited
effectiveness. We also show the added benefits of combining route purging-promotion
with customer route filtering.},
